# Mapping reference

## Annotations

To use annotations in your entities, you must import the `ZfrRest\Resource\Metadata\Annotation` namespace:

```php
use ZfrRest\Resource\Metadata\Annotation as REST;
```

### Resource

Attributes:

* `controller`: FQCN of the controller (pulled from the controller plugin manager)
* `inputFilter`: FQCN of the input filter (pulled from the input filter plugin manager)
* `hydrator`: FQCN of the hydrator (pulled from the hydrator plugin manager).

### Collection

Allow to define mapping when a resource is accessed as a collection.

Attributes:

* `controller`: FQCN of the controller (pulled from the controller plugin manager)
* `hydrator`: FQCN of the hydrator (pulled from the hydrator plugin manager).
