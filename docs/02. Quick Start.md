# Quick Start

In this minimal example, we are going to create an API that allow to create, delete and retrieve one or many users
using ZfrRest.

## Creating your entity

The first thing to do is to create your entity. Let's keep it simple:

```php
<?php

namespace Application\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 * @ORM\Table(name="users")
 */
class User
{
    /**
     * @ORM\Id
     * @ORM\GeneratedValue(strategy="AUTO")
     * @ORM\Column(type="integer")
     *
     * @var int
     */
    protected $id;

    /**
     * @ORM\Column(type="string")
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $username;

    /**
     * @return int
     */
    public function getId()
    {
        return $this->id;
    }

    /**
     * @param string $username
     */
    public function setUsername($username)
    {
        $this->username = (string) $username;
    }

    /**
     * @return string
     */
    public function getUsername()
    {
        return $this->username;
    }
}
```

At this point there is nothing new. We just define fields with Doctrine ORM mapping.

## Adding ZfrRest mapping

Similar to Doctrine annotations, ZfrRest comes with some mapping. Modify your entity so it looks like this:

```php

namespace Application\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use ZfrRest\Resource\Metadata\Annotation as REST;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 * @ORM\Table(name="users")
 * @REST\Resource(
 *      controller="Application\Controller\UserController",
 *      inputFilter="Application\InputFilter\UserInputFilter",
 *      hydrator="Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator\ClassMethods"
 * )
 * @REST\Collection(
 *      controller="Application\Controller\UsersController"
 * )
 */
class User
{
    // ... unchanged
}
```

We added two essential annotations: `Resource` and `Collection`. The `Resource` is used whenever the matched resource
is a single item. For instance, if you reach the URL `/users/1`, what you actually retrieve is a **single** user.
ZfrRest will therefore dispatch it to the controller defined in the `Resource` annotation (in this case,
`Application\Controller\UserController`).

On the other hand, when you reach the URL `/users`, you retrieve a **collection** of users, and ZfrRest uses the
info defined in the `Collection` annotation.

This difference is important and you must be confident with it.

The input filter (which can currently only be defined on the `Resource` annotation) is used whenever ZfrRest needs
to validate data, and is pulled from input filter plugin manager. This typically occurs on POST and PUT operations.

Finally, the hydrator (which is pulled from the hydrator plugin manager) is used for both creating an entity from
POST/PUT data, and extracting entities to return the payload to the client.

## Adding a route

The entry-point of our API is going to be `/users`. Therefore, we need to add the following config to our
`module.config.php` file:

```php
return [
    'router' => [
        'routes' => [
            'users' => [
                'type'    => 'ResourceGraphRoute',
                'options' => [
                    'route'    => '/users',
                    'resource' => 'UserObjectRepository'
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

This code says to ZfrRest that we have an entry point whose URL is `/users`, and that the initial resource is a
Doctrine object repository. This service is pulled from the global service manager. Internally, ZfrRest uses the
Doctrine Criteria API to traverse the hierarchy, that's why we need an object that implements
the `Doctrine\Common\Collections\Selectable` interface.

Add the following config, so that ZfrRest can properly retrieve the object repository:

```php
return [
    'service_manager' => [
        'factories' => [
            'UserObjectRepository' => function($sm) {
                $objectManager = $sm->get('doctrine.entitymanager.orm_default');
                return $objectManager->getRepository('Application\Entity\User');
            }
        ]
    ]
];
```

> If you don't want to define a factory for each repository, you can create an abstract factory, but this is beyond
the scope of this quick start.

## Adding controllers

In our user mapping, we defined two controllers: `Application\Controller\UserController` and
`Application\Controller\UsersController` (remember that controllers are different for single resources and
collection resources!). Let's create them, and add them to your config:

```php
return [
    'controllers' => [
        'invokables' => [
            'Application\Controller\UserController'  => 'Application\Controller\UserController',
            'Application\Controller\UsersController' => 'Application\Controller\UsersController'
        ],
    ],
];
```

### Writing our controllers

Now, let's the fun part begin. For this example, let's assume we want to create a new user, update an existing user,
delete an existing user, retrieving a single user and list all users. Using HTTP verbs, this translates to:

* `POST` /users => add a new user
* `PUT` /users/1 => update an existing user
* `DELETE` /users/1 => delete an existing user
* `GET` /users/1 => retrieve a single user by id
* `GET` /users   => retrieve all users

The question is: which action should belong to which controller? It's actually pretty simple and intuitive once you
understand it. Here is a table that can help you:

HTTP VERB | URI EXAMPLE | CONTROLLER TYPE | TRANSLATION
--------- | ----------- | --------------- | -----------
`POST`    | `/users`    | Collection controller | Adding a new user into a *collection* of users
`PUT`     | `/users/1`  | Resource controller | Modifying an existing, *single* user
`DELETE`  | `/users/1`  | Resource controller | Deleting an existing, *single* user
`GET`     | `/users`    | Collection controller | Retrieving a *collection* of users
`GET`     | `/users/1`  | Resource controller | Retrieving an existing, *single*  user

This can be a bit confusing at first, but it really makes sense once you play with it.

Let's first define our `Application\Controller\UserController`:

```php
<?php

namespace Application\Controller;

use Application\Entity\User;
use ZfrRest\Mvc\Controller\AbstractRestfulController;

class UserController extends AbstractRestfulController
{
    /**
     * @var UserService
     */
    protected $userService;

    public function delete(User $user)
    {
        $this->userService->delete($user);
    }

    public function put(User $user)
    {
        $this->userService->update($user);

        return $this->resourceModel($user);
    }

    public function get(User $user)
    {
        // Do things if you want

        return $this->resourceModel($user);
    }
}
```

Note that ZfrRest controllers extend `ZfrRest\Mvc\Controller\AbstractRestfulController` (of course, nothing prevent
you from using a normal ZF2 controller for some actions).

As you can guess, each "action" is named after the corresponding HTTP method. ZfrRest is flexible enough that you can
add custom HTTP verbs by adding specific method handlers and more public methods in your controller.

The interesting thing is that, contrary to traditional ZF2 controllers, you receive parameter in each method: the
actual resource data (in this case, a User) for the resource that have been matched by the router. You have nothing
to do, this is done automatically by ZfrRest, so that your controller stays really clean. The only thing you need
to do is **passing the resource to the service for your business logic**.

For the `put` method, you don't even need to manually validate the user data, because it has already been validated
using the input filter you specified in the mapping. If data would have been invalid, it would have returned a
`422 Unprocessable Entity` error, with the various error messages under the `errors` key.

If you want automatic serialization of the resource, you must return a ResourceModel (it needs a resource). ZfrRest
provides you a utility controller plugin called `resourceModel` that you can use to create one.

Now, let's see the `Application\Controller\UsersController` controller:

```php
<?php

namespace Application\Controller;

use Application\Entity\User;
use Doctrine\Common\Collections\Selectable;
use DoctrineModule\Paginator\Adapter\Collection as CollectionAdapter;
use Zend\Paginator\Paginator;
use ZfrRest\Mvc\Controller\AbstractRestfulController;

class UsersController extends AbstractRestfulController
{
    /**
     * @var UserService
     */
    protected $userService;

    public function post(User $user)
    {
        $this->userService->create($user);

        return $this->resourceModel($user);
    }

    public function get(Selectable $users)
    {
        // We can do filtering here on the collection, for example using the Doctrine API criteria

        // We could also wrap the collection around a paginator
        $paginator = $this->paginatorWrapper($users);
        $paginator->setCurrentPageNumber($this->params()->fromQuery('page', 1));

        return $this->resourceModel($paginator);
    }
}
```

For the `post` method, it is exactly the same as the `put` method: you don't need to validate anything, because
it has already been done for you. Just pass the entity to your service and you're done!

For the `get` method, we receive a Selectable. Actually, if you are using Doctrine ORM, you can typehint to
`Doctrine\Common\Collections\Selectable`, which is a much more useful interface because it allows to do efficient
filtering.

> Most of the time, an object that implements the `Selectable` interface also implement `Collection` interface. However,
the `Selectable` interface is much more flexible as it has powerful filtering capabilities. That's why you should
always typehint to `Selectable` if you are using Doctrine ORM or Doctrine ODM.

As you can see from the example, we can also wrap the data around a Zend paginator, and then wrap it around
a `ResourceModel`. The `paginatorWrapper` is a simple controller plugin that encapsulate the logic of paginator creation.
You can also optionally pass it a criteria to filter the collection (see the cookbook).

When you return a Paginator, ZfrRest will intelligently serialize the output. For instance, here is an example
of the JSON output:

```json
{
    "limit":10,
    "offset":0,
    "total":3,
    "data":
    [
        {
            "id":1,
            "username":"bar"
        },
        {
            "id":2,
            "username":"foo"
        },
        {
            "id":3,
            "username":"test"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Prevent some HTTP verb

If you don't want a specific HTTP verb, just don't implement the method in your controller. If a user tries to
access this URL, ZfrRest will return a 405 Method Not Allowed exception.

## Associations

REST model is based on URLs. This is a powerful concept and ZfrRest makes it very easy to allow traversal of
associations. For instance, the URL `/users/1/tweets` means: "I want all the tweets from user 1".

Let's add a very simple Tweet entity:

```php
<?php

namespace Application\Entity;

use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;
use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;
use ZfrRest\Resource\Metadata\Annotation as REST;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 * @ORM\Table(name="tweets")
 * @REST\Resource(
 *      controller="Application\Controller\TweetController",
 *      hydrator="Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator\ClassMethods"
 * )
 * @REST\Collection(
 *      controller="Application\Controller\TweetsController"
 * )
 */
class Tweet
{
    /**
     * @ORM\Id
     * @ORM\GeneratedValue(strategy="AUTO")
     * @ORM\Column(type="integer")
     *
     * @var int
     */
    protected $id;

    /**
     * @ORM\Column(type="string")
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $content;

    /**
     * @var User
     *
     * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="User", inversedBy="tweets")
     */
    protected $user;

    /**
     * @return int
     */
    public function getId()
    {
        return $this->id;
    }

    /**
     * @param string $content
     */
    public function setContent($content)
    {
        $this->content = (string) $content;
    }

    /**
     * @return string
     */
    public function getContent()
    {
        return $this->content;
    }

    /**
     * @param User $user
     */
    public function setUser(User $user)
    {
        $this->user = $user;
    }

    /**
     * @return User
     */
    public function getUser()
    {
        return $this->user;
    }
}
```

Let's also modify our User entity (I'm only adding what have changed):

```php
// ...
class User
{
    // ...

    /**
     * @var Tweet[]
     *
     * @ORM\OneToMany(targetEntity="Tweet", mappedBy="user")
     */
    protected $tweets;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->tweets = new ArrayCollection();
    }

    // ...

    /**
     * @param Tweet $tweet
     */
    public function addTweet(Tweet $tweet)
    {
        $tweet->setUser($this);
        $this->tweets->add($tweet);
    }
}
```

If we access to the URL `/users/1/tweets`, we'll reach a collection controller. In `Tweet` entity mapping, we
defined a controller `Application\Controller\TweetsController`. We therefore need to create it:

```php
<?php

namespace Application\Controller;

use Doctrine\Common\Collections\Selectable;
use ZfrRest\Mvc\Controller\AbstractRestfulController;

class TweetsController extends AbstractRestfulController
{
    public function get(Selectable $tweets)
    {
        return $this->resourceModel($tweets);
    }
}
```

And add it to the controller plugin manager in your `module.config.php` file:

```php
return [
    'controllers' => [
        'invokables' => [
            'Application\Controller\TweetsController' => 'Application\Controller\TweetsController',
        ],
    ],
];
```

If you try to access to the `/users/1/tweets` URL now, you'll realize ZfrRest will return a 404 Not Found response.
This is because, by default, ZfrRest block all associations. You manually need to add the `Association` annotation
at the association level, and set the property `routable` to true:

```php
/**
 * @var Tweet[]
 *
 * @ORM\OneToMany(targetEntity="Tweet", mappedBy="user")
 * @REST\Association(routable=true)
 */
protected $tweets;
```

And voilà!

### Customizing the path

By default, ZfrRest uses the name of the association to matches the URI. So if your association is called `tweets`,
the URI will be `/users/1/tweets`. You may want to have your own, custom path. Use the `path` option on the
`Association` annotation:

```php
/**
 * @var Tweet[]
 *
 * @ORM\OneToMany(targetEntity="Tweet", mappedBy="user")
 * @REST\Association(routable=true, path="special-tweets")
 */
protected $tweets;
```

Now, the URI will be `/users/1/special-tweets`.

### Customizing extraction

The Association mapping also supports extraction information. When ZfrRest extracts your data to return it to the
client, it will automatically extract any association. You can have a very granular control over how you want
the association to be serialized:

```php
/**
 * @var Tweet[]
 *
 * @ORM\OneToMany(targetEntity="Tweet", mappedBy="user")
 * @REST\Association(routable=true, extraction="NONE")
 */
protected $tweets;
```

In this example, when a user will be extracted, tweets property won't be outputted to the payload. Possible values
are "NONE", "ID" (default value, it only output identifier values - this can reduce the charge on your database
as no additional queries are made -) and "EMBED" (it will recursively extract the Tweet, as well as any other
association in Tweet that have an "EMBED" extraction strategy).
