## How to implement the OPTIONS method?

You have nothing to do. If you don't use any custom HTTP verbs, when an `OPTIONS` request is made to a resource,
ZfrRest automatically checks which actions are implemented on your controller, and return them in the `Allow` header
of the response.

If you are using custom HTTP verbs, you can implement yourself the `options` action in your controller, and ZfrRest
will use it instead of the built-in discovering behaviour:

```php
class MyController extends AbstractRestfulController
{
    public function options()
    {
        return ['post', 'put', 'funky'];
    }
}
```

## How to customize the payload?

When returning a representation of your resource, you may want to customize heavily the payload. For instance, you
may want to not return the `password` property.

All of this is done through the use of hydrators. You can use built-in ZF2 hydrators like `Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator\ClassMethods`,
but for most complex use cases, the best way is to simply create a custom hydrator, and personalize it.

## How to specify a custom hydrator?

ZfrRest uses hydrators both to hydrate incoming data (for example from POST and PUT requests) and to extract
data. For most advanced cases, you will likely need to define your own hydrators. ZfrRest pulls all the hydrators
from the ZF2 hydrator plugin manager.

Once your hydrator is defined, add it to the hydrator plugin manager using the following config:

```php
return [
    'hydrators' => [
        'invokables' => [
            'Application\Hydrator\UserHydrator' => 'Application\Hydrator\UserHydrator'
        ]
    ]
];
```

## How to specify a custom input filter?

ZfrRest uses input filters to validate data when POSTing and PUTing data. ZfrRest pulls all the input filters from
the ZF2 input filter plugin manager.

Once your input filter is defined, add it to the input filter plugin manager using the following config:

```php
return [
    'input_filters' => [
        'invokables' => [
            'Application\InputFilter\UserInputFilter' => 'Application\InputFilter\UserInputFilter'
        ]
    ]
];
```
